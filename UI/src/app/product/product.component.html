          <p class="insuranceData">Once the fire and/or any of the perils occurs it is likely that the business would be interrupted and owner would
            suffer financial losses and ultimate loss in profit. Normally Gross Profit can be protected under this cover.
            This policy is operative only in conjunction with Fire &amp; Allied Perils and Property Insurance policy.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">As a result of loss due to a fire and the damage it may cause, besides the business coming to a halt, there are
            certain standing charges [fixed expenses] which will continue to be incurred irrespective of the situation. These
            expenses, such as bank interest, employee&#39;s salaries, rent, electricity and other standing charges will need
            to be addressed, in addition to the loss of revenue. The insured suffers financially due to the loss of his gross
            profits; reduced turn-over whilst incurring increasing costs while working during the period of interruption.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p class="insuranceData">P &amp; I Insurance covers the ship owners against their liability. The requirement of every (port)/ ship is required
            to have this cover prior to entering the ports for loading &amp;/or discharging. It covers most of the risks,
            which are historically not written under Marine Hull Insurance.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">In basic terms, Protection and Indemnity insurance, or &quot;P&amp;I&quot; as it is usually called, is a ship owner&#39;s
            insurance cover for legal liabilities to third parties. &quot;Third parties are any person, apart from the ship-owner
            himself, who may have a legal or contractual claim against the ship. P&amp;I insurance is usually arranged by
            entering the ship into a mutual insurance association, usually referred to as a club. Ship-owners are members
            of such clubs. Legal liability is decided in accordance with the laws of the country where an accident takes
            place. The P&amp;I insurance cover for contractual liability which is agreed at the time the owner requests insurance
            cover from the club and is usually in accordance with the owner&#39;s responsibility under crew contracts or
            special terms relating to the trading pattern of the vessel.
          </p>
          <br>

          <div class="paraMain">
            <h4 class="paraTitle">EXPLANATION OF THE TERM, &quot;PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY&quot;</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">The word protection simply means that the insurance also covers assistance when a ship is involved in an accident
              and the ship-owner and his Master need help. Often the club&#39;s early intervention and assistance will help
              to head off problems and serve to protect the ship-owner from inflated claims.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">P&amp;I insurance is an indemnity type of insurance, which means the ship-owner (or member of the club) must
              demonstrate his loss before the club will pay out (or indemnify him) under the terms of the insurance policy.
              It is important to bear in mind that the club never assumes the owner&#39;s liability; therefore, technically
              the owner (or member) is always responsible for payments (the &quot;pay to be paid&quot; principle). In practice,
              the club takes over the business of handling claims and ensuring that payments are correctly made.</p>
            <br>
            <br>


            <h4 class="paraTitle">RUNNING DOWN CLAUSE (RDC) AND FIXED OR FLOATING OBJECTS (FFO)</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">The P&amp;I cover may include liability for collisions (&quot;RDC&quot;), for example when the member&#39;s ship
              is in collision with another ship, or when the entered ship strikes a fixed object, i.e. a quay, dock or buoy
              (&quot;FFO&quot;). However, collision and striking liabilities are often included in the ship&#39;s hull and
              machinery cover, for instance under the Norwegian Insurance Plan. Therefore, it is important for a Master to
              ascertain whether his vessel&#39;s collision insurance (collision between ships) and striking insurance (i.e.
              when a ship strikes a fixed or floating object which is not another ship) is covered under his P&amp;I policy
              or under his hull and machinery policy. To be safe, it is always wise for a Master to inform the P&amp;I club,
              or the club correspondent, if his vessel is in collision with another vessel or a fixed object.</p>
            <br>
            <br>


            <h4 class="paraTitle">DEATH AND PERSONAL INJURY ON BOARD THE VESSEL</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">P&amp;I insurance covers an owner&#39;s liability for all deaths, personal injuries and illnesses which occur
              on board, including death or injury to crew, passengers, stevedores, pilots and visitors to the ship.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4 class="paraTitle">REPATRIATION OF SICK OR INJURED CREW AND HOSPITAL EXPENSES</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">P&amp;I insurance also covers a ship owner’s liability to pay for the costs of repatriating crew members who
              become sick or are injured on board. The insurance also covers the crew&#39;s hospital bills and costs of sending
              replacement personnel to the ship if necessary.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4 class="paraTitle">LOSS OF CREW MEMBERS PERSONAL EFFECTS</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">P&amp;I insurance also covers the owner&#39;s liability for loss of crew belongings in cases of shipwreck or
              fire on board. The cover only applies to items which are deemed to be reasonable for any crew member to have
              with him on board. A crew member travelling with unusually expensive items, such as laptop computers, gold
              watches etc should make sure that he has such items separately insured.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4 class="paraTitle">LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO CARGO</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">One of the major functions of Protection and Indemnity insurance is to cover a shipowner, or the charterer of
              a ship, for liability for loss of, or damage to, cargo if there has been a breach of the contract of carriage.
              This breach of contract usually means that something has happened to the cargo while it was on board the ship
              or being loaded or discharged, and for which the owner or charterer can be held responsible, i.e. shortage
              or damage to the cargo. Therefore, if a Bill of Lading is signed and states that 10,000 sacks of potatoes are
              loaded and only 9,500 are discharged - then the ship (the owner or charterer, or both) may be held liable for
              the loss. Usually, the cargo insurers will pay the person or company who owns the cargo (the receiver) for
              the costs of loss or damage to that cargo. The cargo underwriters will then seek to recover their losses from
              the shipowner or charterer. The P&amp;I club will usually take over the handling of such claims on behalf of
              the assured. This is one of the reasons why evidence in the form of documentation, copies of the log book,
              surveys of damaged cargo, copies of tally books, dated photos of loading in the rain etc are very important
              in establishing the exact reason for the damage. There are certain defences open to the shipowner, such as
              being able to establish that the packaging of the cargo was not good enough to protect it during transportation.</p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4 class="paraTitle">OTHER P&amp;I COVERED RISKS</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Other risks covered include liability for stowaways, liability for oil pollution and other types of pollution
              and legal liability for wreck removal if the ship sinks and is blocking free navigation for other vessels.
              In short, P&amp;I insurance is a very comprehensive type of insurance cover which makes it easier for a shipowner
              or charterer to trade in international shipping transportation. P&amp;I is as important to a prudent shipowner
              as his Hull and Machinery insurance cover.</p>

          <p class="insuranceData">There are several standard aircraft liability policies in the London market, but for the purposes of keeping it
            simple, I will focus primarily on AVN1C, which is the London Aircraft Insurance Policy. This policy is mainly
            used for general aviation business, as opposed to major airlines, which obviously require wider coverage than
            is provided by this standard form. It covers both the hull risks and the insured’s liability to third parties
            and passengers. There are four main sections to AVN1C:</p>
          <br>
          <div class="paraChild1">
            <ul class="aviationli">
              <li>Section I: Loss of or damage to aircraft</li>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <br>

          <div class="paraMain">

            <h4 class="paraTitle">Section I - Loss of or damage to aircraft:</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Insurers will pay for, replace or repair accidental loss of or damage to the aircraft described in the schedule
              under the policy for the risks covered (generally being flight, taxiing and ground risks). It would be common
              for aircraft policies to have a separate premium rate for flight risks and a reduced premium rate for ground
              risks. Operators should be aware of such differentials when seeking insurance, particularly if they have a
              fleet of business jets, which may have long periods of grounding for commercial reasons or economic downturn.
              Operators may be able to negotiate the inclusion of a &#39;lay-up&#39; clause (AVN26A) which would provide
              premium returns for aircraft &#39;laid-up&#39; for a defined period of time, thus keeping insurance costs to
              a minimum, subject to various conditions being met, i.e. not for maintenance/overhaul or repair purposes and
              a minimum of 30 days laid up</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">The policy is underwritten on a &#39;insured value&#39; basis whereby, although a value is attributed to the
              aircraft at inception, the reduced (depreciated) value of the aircraft at the time of any loss is the value
              that would be used for claim settlement in the event of a total loss. This can however be amended to an &#39;agreed
              value&#39; basis, thus the amount to be paid in the event of a total loss is set at inception under the schedule
              of aircraft. Any partial losses will be subject to the applicable deductible. Operators should seek insurance
              on the best terms available regarding lower deductibles. Insurers are flexible in providing alternative premium
              structures to accommodate various deductible options and the current market for business jets appears to be
              softening, insofar that very low deductibles can be achieved.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Turbojet aircraft are susceptible to foreign object damage despite recent improvements in design efforts. Operators
              should note that foreign object damage is only covered if it is attributable to a &#39;single recorded incident&#39;
              (being recorded in the aircraft technical log). However, consequent damage sustained to other parts of the
              aircraft is covered.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Spares coverage is often included within Section I at an additional premium, rated against &#39;values at risk&#39;.
              Operators should ensure that their spares inventory is kept up to date and declared to their broker.</p>
            <br>

          <div class="paraMain">
            <h4 class="paraTitle">Section II - Legal Liability to third parties (other than passengers):</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Insurers will indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally liable to pay as damages (including
              costs) in respect of accidental bodily injury or property damage caused by the aircraft or by any person or
              object falling therefrom.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">The policy excludes injury to employees, namely directors/employees acting in the course of their employment,
              operational crew (can be written back in), passengers (insured under Section III), property belonging to, or
              in the care, custody and control of the insured, noise and pollution as defined under aviation clause AVN46B.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Operators should consider the limit of indemnity being purchased and seek advice from their insurance broker
              to ensure that the limit provides adequate protection given their fleet size, aircraft type and area of operation.
              In Europe, the EU will also have to be adhered to with regards to minimum insurance liability limits for both
              passengers and third parties, which is determined by aircraft type, take-off weights and seating capacity.

          <div class="paraMain">
            <h4 class="paraTitle">Section III: Legal Liability to passengers:</h4>
            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Insurers will indemnify the insured for all sums the insured becomes legally liable to pay as damages (including
              costs) in respect of accidental bodily injury to passengers whilst entering, on board or alighting from the
              aircraft and for loss of or damage to baggage/personal effects arising out of an accident to the aircraft.
              Again, employees and operational crew are excluded. Operators may wish to consider purchasing an independent
              Personal Accident policy to cover pilots, crew and other passengers.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Operators again need to consider the limits of indemnity purchased for passenger liability. Most limits are purchased
              on a &#39;combined&#39; basis in conjunction with Section II above. It would not be uncommon for insurers to
              impose &#39;passenger caps&#39; on certain areas of operation to limit their liability on a &#39;per passenger&#39;
              basis, so this should be considered and negotiated should the need arise, with particular reference to their
              lease/finance agreements, to ensure there are no coverage shortfalls. A &#39;passenger cap&#39;, for example,
              might be included if operators were regularly flying to the USA, given the litigious nature of this country,
              i.e. &#39;passenger liability in respect of operations within the USA would be limited to US$500,000 each and
              every passenger&#39;.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Section III would be subject to general exclusions such as &#39;illegal uses&#39;, those uses not stated in the
              policy at inception. Geographical limitations are also imposed where cover is excluded outside the areas stated
              in the policy. Operators should therefore be actively keeping their broker up to date with regards to the areas
              of operation, although it would not be uncommon for many business jet policies to have &#39;worldwide&#39;
              coverage as standard. Nuclear risks and war, hijacking and other perils are also excluded by virtue of standard
              market clauses.

          <h4 class="insuranceDataSubHead">2. War, Hijacking and Other Perils Exclusion Clause (Aviation) – AVN48B</h4>
          <p class="insuranceData">It is standard for AVN48B to be included within the wording of a policy. This clause &#39;expands&#39; the exclusion
            beyond those pure &#39;war&#39; perils and operators should pay close attention to what perils are excluded.
            In essence, the clause excludes above and beyond the basic &#39;war, invasion and acts of foreign enemies&#39;
            and goes further to exclude (inter alia) any hostile detonation of a weapon, strikes, riots, civil commotions,
            malicious acts or acts of sabotage, confiscation, nationalisation, seizure by any government or local authority
            and hijacking without the consent of the insured.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">It is common practice for operators to &#39;buy-back&#39; the majority of these exclusions in respect of both hull
            and liability coverage. Operators can purchase a liability &#39;writeback&#39; which provides liability coverage
            for the majority of the excluded perils contained in AVN48B. This clause is known as AVN52 and is regularly amended
            and updated. The majority of insurers now offer this coverage up to the &#39;Combined Single Liability Limit&#39;
            within their policy and operators should ensure that such coverage is in line with their lease/finance agreements
            in order to avoid any shortfalls. If, on occasions the incumbent insurer is unable to offer AVN52 coverage up
            to the limit of liability, then it can be purchased as an excess layer independently through alternative insurers
            with such capacity.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">Hull war can also be purchased independently, known as LSW555D (also regularly updated and revised). The coverage
            provided mirrors that excluded by AVN48B in respect of hull coverage, with one exception, namely in essence,
            nuclear detonation. War policies often pay up to 90 per cent of extortion, confiscation and hijack expenses.
            Operators should note that &#39;confiscation by the Government of Registry&#39; of the aircraft is excluded,
            although this could be added back into the policy at an additional premium. Repossession by any title holder
            is also excluded, alongside the market wide &#39;five major powers&#39; exclusion, which is mandatory.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">There are several standard aircraft liability policies in the London market, but for the purposes of keeping it
            simple, I will focus primarily on AVN1C, which is the London Aircraft Insurance Policy. This policy is mainly
            used for general aviation business, as opposed to major airlines, which obviously require wider coverage than
            is provided by this standard form. It covers both the hull risks and the insured’s liability to third parties
            and passengers. There are four main sections to AVN1C: Section I: Loss of or damage to aircraft Section II: Legal
            liability to third parties (other than passengers) Section III: Legal liability to passengers Section IV: General
            exclusions applicable to all sections Conditions precedent applicable to all sections General conditions applicable

              <p class="insuranceDataGoldHeading">However, in most states, these are not legal claims in and of themselves, but are pleaded in terms of the theories
                mentioned above. For example, a plaintiff might plead negligent failure to warn or strict liability for defective
                design.

                <li>Manufacturing defects are those that occur in the manufacturing process and usually involve poor-quality
                  materials or shoddy workmanship.</li>
                <li> Design defects occur where the product design is inherently dangerous or useless (and hence defective) no
                  matter how carefully manufactured; this may be demonstrated either by showing that the product fails to
                  satisfy ordinary consumer expectations as to what constitutes a safe product, or that the risks of the
                  product outweigh its benefits.
                </li>
                <li>Failure-to-warn defects arise in products that carry inherent nonobvious dangers which could be mitigated
                  through adequate warnings to the user, and these dangers are present regardless of how well the product
                  is manufactured and designed for its intended purpose. Product liability is a protection against financial
                  loss arising out of the legal liability incurred by an insured because of injury or damage resulting from
                  the use of a covered product or out of the liability incurred by a contractor after a job is completed.</li>

          <p class="insuranceData">Product liability insurance protects companies in the event that the products they have manufactured injure someone
            or cause property damage. In the case of lawsuits, product liability insurance protects a business financially
            due to claims or product defects. If you manufacture products to sell to the public it is a good idea to get
            product liability insurance so you can avoid unpleasant situations like a lawsuit that could possibly put you
            into bankruptcy or cause you to go out of business.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="insuranceData">Product liability insurance policies go a long way in giving you the security you need as a business to produce
            products that are useful and valuable to your customers. However, you need to be aware of the implications arising
            from producing your products once they get into the hands of the consumers that will purchase them.</p>

                policy only covers claims made during the policy period. More specifically, a typical policy will provide
                indemnity to the insured against loss arising from any claim or claims made during the policy period by reason
                of any covered error, omission or negligent act committed in the conduct of the insured&#39;s professional
                business during the policy period. Claims which may relate to incidents occurring before the coverage was
                active may not be covered, although some policies may have a retroactive date, such that claims made during
                the policy period but which relate to an incident after the retroactive date (where the retroactive date
                is earlier than the inception date of the policy) are covered.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Coverage does not include criminal prosecution, nor all forms of legal liability under civil law, only those
                specifically enumerated in the policy. Cyber liability, covering data breach and other technology issues,
                may not necessarily be included in core policies, although it is readily available on the market.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Some policies are more tightly worded than others and while a number of policy wordings are designed to satisfy
                a stated minimum approved wording, which makes them easier to compare, others differ dramatically in the
                coverage they provide. For example, breach of duty may be included if the incident occurred and was reported
                by the policy holder to the insurer during the policy period. Wordings with major legal differences can be
                confusingly similar to non-lawyers. Coverage for &quot;negligent act, error or omission&quot; indemnifies
                the policyholder against loss/circumstances incurred only as a result of any professional error or omission,
                or negligent act (i.e., the modifier &quot;negligent&quot; does not apply to all three categories, though
                any non-legal reader might assume that it did). A &quot;negligent act, negligent error or negligent omission&quot;
                clause is a much more restrictive policy, and would deny coverage in a lawsuit alleging a non-negligent error
                or omission.</p>
              <br>
              <br>

              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Coverage is usually continued for as long as the policyholder provides covered services or products, plus the
                span of any applicable statute of limitations. Cancelling the policy before this time would in effect make
                it as if the insured never had coverage for any incidents, since any client could bring any case with regard
                to any such services or products that occurred before the statute of limitations cut-off point. A break in
                coverage could result in what is called a &quot;gap in coverage,&quot; which is the loss of all prior acts.</p>

          <p class="insuranceData"> In dealing with construction projects, the terms &quot;Bonds&quot; and &quot;Bank Guarantees&quot; often come up.
            Bonds and bank guarantees can offer different facilities, and it is important in making financial decisions that
            these differences can be discerned. Making the best decisions for your unique circumstances requires an understanding
            of the way bond insurance operates and how it can be used to achieve a variety of your financial goals as well
            as a sense of how bond insurances are priced, the dynamics that drive the market and the various risks involved
            for you whether you are a contractor or a developer. This guide, intended as an introduction to Bond Insurance
            for interested parties offers information on the three main types of bond insurance, as well as tips useful to
            making a decision on purchasing bond insurance.</p>

          <p class="insuranceData">Bond Insurance adds several value-enhancing features to those who are involved in a construction project:</p>
          <br>


          <ol class="aviationli">
            <li>With bond insurance, a principal has a backup source of payment to rely on if the contractor cannot meet his
              obligations.
            </li>
            <li>For the contractor, it comes at a huge cost saving in that he does not have to freeze his capital as in the case
              of purchasing a bank guarantee.</li>

          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Medical malpractice insurance, a claims made policy, is only available to a practitioner involved in the health
            industry so that they will be protected in the event of a judgment against them for medical malfeasance.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">This cover is required by the regulatory authorities and can be obtained by practitioners as individuals or group-wise
            as employees of an entity.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">There is an economy of scale, which allows premiums to be lower in total than each practitioner buying a separate
            cover. Also the Entity Insurance extends cover to include risk, which would normally be excluded under individual
            cover.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Since practitioners are sued infrequently, the data is actuarially unsound, making it impossible for a physician
            to be &quot;rated&quot; based on past history. So, while history is important to know, practitioners are classified
            based on their specialties, and the rates are set accordingly.</p>

          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Now-a-days, Wealth management has become a full time job because of various options of investment spanning equity,
            bonds, money market instruments, currency, commodity, metal etc.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Insurance-related Investments are also another channel of managing wealth. These products will give one a window
            to manage wealth for various purposes in one’s life during the entire lifespan.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Taxation, Regulations, Territorial rules or implications also come into play when wealth management planning is

          <p class="insuranceDataWhite">
            <b>The main products that can be offered to clients are based on;</b>
          </p>
          <br>

<div class="paraChild1">
          <p class="paraTitleNew">Estate Planning:-</p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Regular or lump sum savings can create an Asset or Estate which can be utilized for specific
              purposes during one’s life. Assets thus created will be useful during times when you need to buy estate or
              property etc. Specific products or plans or programs can be designed to suit one’s requirements.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Education Planning:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Children’s education is one thing about which every parent is always anxious and wishes
              to ensure the highest quality education for professional courses for his/her child. With the ever rising inflation
              and cost of education, it is very much necessary that the planning for it starts at the earliest stage of a
              child’s life.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Marriage Planning:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Marriage is desired for and by everyone. Marriage can demand excessive arrangements of capital,
              in most societies, as it shapes the life of an individual and a family thereafter. With proper arrangements
              of capital from the very beginning it becomes very much convenient for a family to take care of its child’s
              marriage expenses vis-à-vis its ever increasing costs.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Retirement Planning:-</p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite"> Dying early is a serious problem, but living too long is a more serious problem. Unfortunately,
              most of us ignore this problem. With the increase in the longevity of an average human life year after year,
              now 74 years, it becomes a problem to be self-dependent financially, physically, emotionally etc. Being independent
              financially will have much convenience in our late life. Many countries in this world don’t have any arrangements,
              of any sort, for the elderly people living longer. Early start will need only smaller amounts being saved regularly
              to create a capital granting much needed financial independence. Starting savings late in life means losing
              a great deal on accumulation and thus compromising to a great extent to suffer late in life.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Business Capital Funding:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Project funding or financing is required for businesses or companies to have their
              dreams of doing business fulfilled. Funding can provide much needed oxygen at the right time to a business
              to take its desired course. Many forms of funding or financing can be arranged.
            </p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Mortgage Insurance:-
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite"> Companies need funds to do business or to be in business. Many times, they need funding
              arrangements from a bank or a financial institution. The financial institution will ask for mortgage arrangements
              before releasing the loan or funds or finance arrangements.Mortgage Insurance is a handy tool to meet unforeseen
              events for the company besides insuring loss of capital for the bank or financial institution.
            </p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Business Insurance:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Many forms of insurances are available under Business Insurance. It is only a matter of
              choice and convenience for a business entity to use it in the form it deems fit, proper and necessary. Sometimes
              it can be only for creating capital or ensuring cash flow arrangements or mitigating the risk of losing any
              key man or woman.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Jumbo Insurance:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">It is a form of arrangement wherein high or big value arrangements are done for HNWIs. In it,
              insurance policies are issued for a very long term with guaranteed returns and arranging funds through banks
              or financial institutions for premium payments. Premiums can be paid in lump sum or on regular intervals. Like
              other insurance policies, these also come with a great deal of flexibility.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Regulatory Insurance:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">This kind of arrangement will take care of the local labour laws effective through Ministry
              of Labour, Saudi. Gratuity or End of service benefits payable under the Ministry of Labour laws can be a drain
              on the cash flow arrangements or finances of a company operating here in Saudi, if not properly taken care
              of. Section 132 and 149 of this law enforces companies operating in Saudi to follow certain instructions. Failure
              to do so will have very serious consequences for businesses.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Liability Insurance:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">This arrangement takes care of manifold liabilities for an individual or a business entity
              operating anywhere in the world. This is a new concept picking up very fast in the complex business environment
              involving risks of complex nature.</p><br>
            <p class="paraTitleNew">Will:- </p>
              <p class="insuranceDataWhite">Living in a country like Saudi always gives us much comfort in terms of world-class facilities available
              anywhere in the world. But a topic that gives us concern is whether Sharia Law will be applicable on the financial
              or investment products that we buy in Saudi. What is Sharia Law and how does it affect most of us? A Will is
              a document that can take away much of your worries. How a Will is prepared, what does it do, what benefits
              does it offer, how is it legalized, what are its implications? All these questions can be addressed with our
              expertise.</p><br>

            needs for the entire life span.</p>

          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Risk can be defined as the combination of the probability of an event and its consequences. In all types of undertaking,
            there is the potential for events and consequences that constitute opportunities for benefit (upside) or threats
            to success (downside).</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Risk management is a central part of any organisation’s strategic management. It is the process whereby organizations
            methodically address the risks attaching to their activities with the goal of achieving sustained benefit within
            each activity and across the portfolio of all activities.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">The focus of good risk management is the identification and treatment of these risks. Its objective is to add maximum
            sustainable value of all the activities of the organization. It marshals the understanding of the potential upside
            and downside of all those factors which can affect the organisation. It increases the probability of success,
            and reduces both the probability of failure and the uncertainty of achieving the organisation’s overall objectives.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="insuranceData">Risk management should be a continuous and developing process which runs throughout the organisation’s strategy
            and the implementation of that strategy. It should address methodically all the risks surrounding the organisation’s
            activities past, present and in particular, future.</p>
